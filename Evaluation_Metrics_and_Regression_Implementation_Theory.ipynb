It ranges from 0 to 1, where 0 means no explanation of variance and 1 means complete explanation. For example, an R-squared of 0.85 means 85% of the variability in the dependent variable is explained by the model. It's useful for assessing the model's fit, but a higher value doesn't always mean a better model."
